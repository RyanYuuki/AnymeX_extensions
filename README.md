# AnymeX Extensions Repository

Welcome to the **AnymeX Extensions** repository! This repository serves as a hub for extensions designed to enhance and customize the functionality of the **AnymeX** app. 

## About AnymeX Extensions

The AnymeX app supports modular extensions that enable users to extend the app's capabilities. These extensions can be easily downloaded and added, giving users flexibility in how they interact with manga sources, data fetching, and other functionalities within the app.

## Features

- **Modular Extensions**: Each extension is stored as a separate Dart file and can be added to the app for enhanced functionality.
- **Seamless Integration**: Extensions are designed to work with AnymeX's **Extension Handler**, allowing you to plug in new sources and handlers globally.
- **Customizable**: Developers can create and add their own extensions, expanding the app's reach and capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- **AnymeX** app installed with version X.X or later.

## Usage

To add an extension:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Place your custom extension in the designated extensions folder within AnymeX's file system.
3. Reload the app to have AnymeX recognize the new extension automatically.
